I should upload variables.py, but not variables.py.docx.(also triangle.py, mystery_code.py, and pizza_party.py)
I have changed this into python text.
I check that d and e have been created correctly and compared (e should be greater than d)
And I also check that W should be true only if both X and Y are True

In triangle.py:Pseudocode has been used and the code is  documented


In file_mystery.py:There is a commented line that says what the code does: Selects ten random numbers between 1 and 100 and then print the last one
