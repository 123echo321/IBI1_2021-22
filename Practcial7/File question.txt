question:South Korea, Kenya, and Colombia are three countries , but they have similar populations. 
Plot the total number of COVID cases over time in three countries

line numberï¼š137-213

Hypothesis: 
With similar populations in all three countries, it would be reasonable to expect a similar number of people to be infected.
but as a result of improper measures taken by the South Korean government, the number of infections in South Korea should be much higher than in the other two countries

The result is Consistent with the hypothesis.
South Korea's highest number of infections was close to 10,000.
Kenya's highest number of infections was close to 50.
Colombia's highest number of infections was close to 800.
